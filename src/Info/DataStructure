& DS are different was to organizing data on your computer.
==> eg - if you choose black color in unstructor color box

& DS has two types
 - Primitive(integer,float,char,boolean)
 - NonPrimitive


Algo is good when :
-Correctness
-Efficency

Types of Algorithms
 -Simple recursive 
 -divide and conquer
 -Dynamic programming
 -Greedy 
 -Brute force
 -Randomized
 
 Recusion 
  -perform same operation multiple time with d/f input
  -each step problem will break in small problems
  -base Condition is compulsory
  
 Why Recursion
  -a method call itself
  -exit from infinite rule
  
recursion may crash system
itteration may effect cpu cycles
